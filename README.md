# UltraPlan — VisQuanta Blog Portal

Autonomous, high-quality blog generation engine for [visquanta.com](https://visquanta.com). Produces 3 source-grounded posts per week across three editorial lanes (daily SEO, weekly authority, monthly anonymized case study), gated by five hard quality checks and reviewed by a human via GitHub PR before publishing.

## Status

**Phase 0 — Design complete.** The full 532-line design spec is at [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-09-visquanta-blog-portal-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-09-visquanta-blog-portal-design.md). Every architectural decision is finalized there.

**Phase 1 — Bootstrap Steps 1–5** is the current build target. See the implementation plan at `~/.claude/plans/async-riding-leaf.md`.

## Core principles (from spec §2)

1. **No source = no sentence.** Every paragraph binds to a verbatim quote in a pre-assembled research bundle.
2. **Reputable allowlist only.** Sources are whitelisted in `config/sources.yaml` — no open-web scraping.
3. **Five hard gates, none optional.** Drafts that fail any gate retry (max 3) or are blocked from the human review queue.
4. **Human reviews only what passed.** GitHub PR review is the only publishing surface. Merge = publish.
5. **Best model at every step.** Quality is the only selection axis — cost is logged, never enforced.

## How it publishes

UltraPlan opens PRs into [`visquanta-dev/site`](https://github.com/visquanta-dev/site) with:
- `content/blog/<slug>.md` (frontmatter compatible with the existing `src/lib/seobot.ts` parser)
- `public/images/blog/<slug>/*.webp` (hero + inline images)

The main visquanta.com site already supports local markdown overrides via its hybrid SEObot + local-content loader. **No changes to the main site are required for UltraPlan to publish.**
